# Example-work-for-future-employers
This repo consists of work I conducted for: 

1. A restaurant data business called onescnd where data of several restaurants was stored in a SQL database and portrayed on a secured website with graphs and heatmaps to show what customers ordered at what time and where on their restaurant overview.

2. A bachelor (hons equivalent in nZ) thesis where I worked at PFR(Plant and Food Research New Zealand) where I had to find sex differences in DNA with statistical tools in Python/R/BASH and design molecular markers. 

3. Some PhD work in machine learning where I had to predict fish growth.

4. A JAVA application for a writers app and a pipeline for genomic processing in Snakemake with JAVA/Python.
