This repo consists of work I conducted for: 

1. A restaurant data business called onescnd where data of several restaurants was stored in a SQL database and portrayed on a secured website with graphs and heatmaps to show what customers ordered at what time and where on their restaurant overview. Made in Django with HTML/CSS/JS/Python. See below an example pic of the website:
