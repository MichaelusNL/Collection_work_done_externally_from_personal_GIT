# Example-work-for-future-employers

This repo consists mainly of work from about 1.5 years of which 1 year belongs to a bachelor thesis and half a year is dedicated to a PhD thesis. This repo serves as giving examples of bio-informatics work done for future employers. Also added a sideproject of 3 months of making a website in the Netherlands, this was done with Django and the goal was to store data from restaurants of orders (time of the order/type of order/frequency etc.) and transform this into heatmaps and graphs for restaurant owners to get insight in their data.
